    "# Summarization checker chain\n",
    "This notebook shows some examples of LLMSummarizationCheckerChain in use with different types of texts.  It has a few distinct differences from the `LLMCheckerChain`, in that it doesn't have any assumptions to the format of the input text (or summary).\n",
    "Additionally, as the LLMs like to hallucinate when fact checking or get confused by context, it is sometimes beneficial to run the checker multiple times.  It does this by feeding the rewritten \"True\" result back on itself, and checking the \"facts\" for truth.  As you can see from the examples below, this can be very effective in arriving at a generally true body of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "您可以通过设置 max_checks 参数来控制检查器的运行次数。默认值为 2，但如果您不想进行任何重复检查，也可以将其设置为 1。"

      "   **判断：True**  \n",
      "   **说明：** 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜确实在2023年对“green peas”星系进行了研究。这些星系因其颜色和形态而得名，是恒星形成活跃的小型星系，JWST利用其强大的红外成像能力对它们进行了详细观测。\n",

      "   **说明：** “Green pea”星系是2007年通过“星系动物园”（Galaxy Zoo）项目首次发现的，并在2009年由相关论文正式发表。它们确实体积小、呈绿色、密度高，且恒星形成率高。\n",

      "   **判断：True**  \n",
      "   **说明：** 由于“green peas”星系与早期宇宙中的星系在性质上相似（如恒星形成率高、金属含量低），JWST的研究确实有助于科学家模拟和理解宇宙早期的恒星形成过程。\n",

      "4. **JWST拍摄了一些年龄超过130亿年的星系图像。**  \n",

      "   **说明：** JWST的红外能力使其能够观测到距离地球超过130亿光年的星系，这些星系的光是在宇宙诞生后不久发出的，因此它们的“年龄”可被视为超过130亿年。\n",

      "1. **\"Mammals can lay eggs.\"**  \n",
      "   - **True**.  \n",
      "   - Some mammals do lay eggs. These are called **monotremes**, and they include the **platypus** and **echidna**. While most mammals give birth to live young, these exceptions lay eggs, making the statement true.\n",

      "   - **True**.  \n",
      "   - Birds and mammals are distinct classes of animals. Birds belong to the class **Aves**, while mammals belong to the class **Mammalia**. They differ in many ways, including having feathers (birds) versus fur (mammals), laying eggs (all birds, only some mammals), and differences in reproduction, thermoregulation, and anatomy.\n",
